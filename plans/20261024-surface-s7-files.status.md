# Status: S7 SQL files and build freshness

Created 2026-10-24. Status: OPEN. Implementation has not started.
Task: [task file](20261024-surface-s7-files.task.md).
Specs: ADR17 S7/D6; ADR16 surface/tool boundary.

## Decisions and evidence

The 2026-10-24 owner decision keeps exact SQLite result-column metadata and
native Lake tracking, and corrects the guide's blanket importer-rebuild claim.
The source audit establishes available native Lake input and needs APIs.
Package-root discovery and stale-build inspection still need real fixtures.
No production file elaborator, registry or checker exists at the inspected base.

Proof-cost reporting is required S7 scope and will have a bounded collector
prototype followed by its implementation contract. Checked SQL doc blocks have
their own reviewed task. Neither is silently excluded by this task boundary.

## Progress

- 2026-10-24: specified file semantics, lexical marker behavior, source records,
  installed checker and incremental consumer acceptance. Await independent
  review and an available implementation slot. Shared-helper ownership must be
  reserved with editor/doc-block tasks before concurrent implementation.
